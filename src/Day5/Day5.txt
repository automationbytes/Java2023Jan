Polymorphism
-----------

Poly - many
morph - forms

Same method gonna act differently in diff situation

Overloading - Compile time polymorphism - early binding
Overriding - run time polymorphism - late binding

Overloading - Same method name wit diff parameters
Readability
Reusability

Rules:
No of arguments always different
Atleast need to maintain change of order of arguments
Access modifiers
Within the same class

==========================
Static and final methods cant be overloaded
Private methods cant be overloaded
Java doesnt support Operator overloading -( c++)


===========================================================
Overriding
----------
runtime polymorphism - late binding

parent

partner - xyz
house

child  - abc


Rules
-----
Same Method signature (name, parameters, return type)
Access modifiers - 
We cant override static and final methods (also private methods)
Constructors also cant be overrided

Abstract class
Abstract methods and non Abstract methods

interfaces - 100% abstraction


mobile

call
sms


Samsung - Andriod
Apple - ios


========================================

Access modifiers

public 
protected
private
default

============================================


Throwable class

Error - Unrecoverable

Exceptions - recoverable

Compile time exception - Checked exceptions
Runtime exceptions _ unchecked exceptions


try

catch

finally


throw
